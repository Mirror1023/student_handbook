    <h1>Student Handbook LLM<h1>
</div>

The goal of this project is to build an interactive website where users/students can ask questions about their Student Handbook and obtain reliable answers from a connection to a Large Language Model such as OpenAI's GPT.


The first series of exploratory data analysis on this dataset can be found in the "text_extract01.ipynb" file. This file prepares the data for modeling by reading the pdf file and converting it into clean text and then segmenting that text accordingly. This also combines the other handbooks into the clean text file as well.

The app.py file contains the Flask app. The template.html file has the code for the web app. There are some python files within the src folder which contain data loading and data cleaning functions.
