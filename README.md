    <h1>Student Handbook LLM<h1>

The goal of this project is to build an interactive website where users/students can ask questions about their Student Handbook and obtain reliable answers from a connection to a Large Language Model such as OpenAI's GPT.


The first series of exploratory data analysis on this dataset can be found in the "text_extract01.ipynb" file. This file prepares the data for modeling by handling reading the pdf file and converting it into clean text and then segmenting that text accordingly.
